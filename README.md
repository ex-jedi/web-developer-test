# Web Developer Test

Hi, and thanks for your time.

 I've used [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) task runner for this test. The relevant dependencies are in the `package.json` file. Fork or clone the `main` branch, open a terminal in the root directory and run `npm install` to install them. Then run `npm start` to spin up Parcel. A `localhost` URL for a development server will then be shown in the terminal.

I've included the `dist` folder in case you wanted to see the compiled assets.

In my day to day work I usually use [Prepros](https://prepros.io/), but I've used Parcel here as it's better for portability.

I've also included my linting setup which is from Wes Bos' repo [here](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos).

Thanks again for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
